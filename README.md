# Pastrami
Pastrami is a lightweight solution for securely storing encrypted text. It is designed to provide a quick and efficient way to store sensitive information, ensuring that each piece of data is encrypted using its own unique item ID as the encryption key. 

# Features
- **Memory-Only database**: Pastrami can operate entirely in memory, offering fast access and retrieval of encrypted text without persisting data to disk.
- **Item ID Encryption**: Each piece of text is encrypted using its corresponding item ID. This ensures that the encryption key is unique to each stored item, enhancing the security of your sensitive data.
 - **Simple and Lightweight**: The service is designed to be easy to use and does not impose unnecessary complexity. Integration with your applications or systems is straightforward.
